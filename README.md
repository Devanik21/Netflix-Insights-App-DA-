## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-link>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas plotly google-generativeai seaborn matplotlib wordcloud scikit-learn
    ```
    *(It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment)*

3.  **Prepare Your Data:**
    *   Ensure you have a CSV file named `netflix_analysis.csv` in the same directory as `app.py`.
    *   The application is pre-configured to load this file. You can modify the loading logic in `app.py` if your file has a different name or path.
    *   The dataset should ideally contain columns like `title`, `type`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in` (genres), `description`, `imdb_score`, `budget_millions`, `views_millions`, etc. Not all columns are mandatory for all tools, but more complete data will enable more features.

4.  **Set Up Gemini API Key (Optional but Recommended for AI Tools):**
    *   Obtain a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
    *   When you run the app, there will be a field in the sidebar to enter your API key. This key is used for Tools 31-35 and Tool 51.

5.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `app.py`, and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your default web browser should open with the dashboard.
